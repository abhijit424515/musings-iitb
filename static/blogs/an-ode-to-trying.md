For a lot of things in life, there are people around that just… can. Maybe they all attended a secret summer club for the talented and figured it out, some meetup you weren’t invited to, maybe they were born with it, but they can see musical notes and mathematical equations. They can visualize intuitively what you couldn’t fathom writing down. They can devour linear algebra for breakfast, while you’re trying to figure out why your alarm didn’t go off.


As children, we’re showered with heaps of praise for being “talented” at the slightest hint of being a fast learner. We’re conditioned to believe all of us are meant to be good at something, that we’re just born with. The idea that talent is something we’re meant to discover is deeply ingrained in us. As if skills you acquire from learning are artificial diamonds, their luminance pales in front of real discovered diamonds, their existence itself a giant farce.
Because being gifted is just… easier. All our heroes were gifted people. We look up to Mozart and Terence Tao, we are awestruck by Ramanujan and Jimi Hendrix. John Mayer can perform Neon in perfect tune, half asleep while you can’t properly strum the ukulele that’s sat collecting dust in a corner.


You wish you could do it effortlessly. You wish you exuded a kind of nonchalance that people at the top of their game do. Wouldn’t it be nice to believe for once that *I’ve got this, I know what I’m doing.*


Sometimes there’s this looming dread of *this is the farthest I’ll come. There’s always going to be places I won’t get to and moments I won’t live because I’m not good enough.* You can’t get everything in life just because you wanted it the most or tried the most. Sometimes hard work just isn’t gonna be enough. *What if I don’t have the music gene, or the math gene, or the “I could swim the English Channel while devising proofs for conjectures in the time it takes you to get up in the morning” gene?* Unchecked, this devolves into you feeling like an imposter who doesn’t belong, who somehow hacked their way, cheated the system, sacrificed children to make it here, only by trying too hard.


And what are you to do, if not repress this feeling? Talk about it? Preposterous! God forbid if you mention taking your time and struggling with something, because everyone around is just too cool to get why sometimes you have to stop and…. bask. Breathe for a while. They’d probably scoff at the possibility. And you remember there was a time where you didn’t have to try either. You just knew long division, the same way you knew mitochondria is the … okay, okay.


When did success become a closed gatekept community? We’re afraid to share our struggles because the secret agents of talented people co. are always listening. Your lame track record doesn’t sit well.


This fear of being imperfect permeates into other aspects of our life. We’re afraid of our own mediocrities. We don’t sing out loud because our voice doesn’t quite leave the room awestruck. We don’t dance our heart out to tunes in fear of making a fool of ourselves, because trying to dance, in all our amateurism, somehow feels more embarrassing than conceding to our ineptness and accepting that this simply isn’t for me. A form of expression of how we feel, isn’t for me to express how I feel. Doesn’t that sound ludicrous? We don’t try to sketch the dogs and the trees around us, because it looks like a child filling their 4th grade workbook. We don’t write songs and poems and about our deepest convictions, because our poems don’t elicit the response Javed Akhtar’s would, and because our articles are yet another tryhard wannabe writing attempt. Because to write when you’re not a natural is completely unacceptable. because art is only for the seasoned practitioners, and you better be *cultured af* if you ever dream of partaking in it, pleb!


So here’s to writing your heart out, singing imperfect notes, bringing out unpolished moves. Here’s to trying things because they bring you joy, to putting all your soul into it without expecting every creation to be your magnum opus. Here’s to running out of breath mid-runs, and having your legs get sore after a long cycling journey. Here’s to getting ruthlessly dunked on in basketball, and, almost stubbornly, returning every time to play. Here’s to going boulder climbing, and getting stuck on the same level for weeks, falling down with all your weight and still having the audacity to begin another climb. Because what would you rather be, to excel at this? A monkey?


Here’s to struggling with projects and concepts, with deadlines and tests, and honestly giving your all to get through,


Here’s an ode to trying.
