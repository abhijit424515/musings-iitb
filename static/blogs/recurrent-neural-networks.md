## Why Recurrent Neural Networks ?
- Fixed-sized inputs and outputs may not always be a reasonable choice. Examples include speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment classification, etc.
- Contextual information is very crucial
  - Hard to choose a fixed content window
- RNNs are a family of neural networks that are better suited to handle sequential data
